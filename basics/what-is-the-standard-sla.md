Contact us for a premium SLA at [enterprise@algolia.com](mailto:enterprise@algolia.com).As a side note, our SLA are not guaranteed if you use our REST API directly (or build your own wrappers). Our API clients are not only wrappers of the REST API, but contain a lot of logic to optimize the availability and performance of our service.
