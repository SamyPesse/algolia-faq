A cluster is a group of servers. On all of our plans, your data is duplicated in a cluster of three identical servers.

There are multiple reasons for us to create this redundancy:

*   Availability: If one or two servers go down the users of your website won’t be affected. We’ve never had 3 servers from the same cluster down at the same time.
*   Redundancy: Having 3 live copies of your data makes it very unlikely that we’ll ever lose it
*   Scalability: Well, you get the picture, 3 servers work better and faster than one.
