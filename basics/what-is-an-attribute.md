An attribute is a characteristic of an object that you have indexed in Algolia.

In the following example, “name”, “type” and “color” are 3 different attributes of the given record.

<pre>{
  name: “Apple”,
  type: “Fruit”,
  color: “Green”
}</pre>

With Algolia, your objects can have as many attributes as you want, as long as you fit into the limit size of 10kb per record.
