A record is an object you add to an index and want to search for. It can contain any number of attributes.

Here is an example of a record, formatted in JSON:

<pre>{
  "name": “Iphone 6 64Gb”,
  "brand": “Apple”,
  "color": “Gold”,
  "categories": [“smartphone”, “phone”, “electronics”],
  "price": 789
}</pre>
