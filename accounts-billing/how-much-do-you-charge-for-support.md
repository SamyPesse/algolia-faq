Nothing! Support is built into each of our pricing options, so you’ll never pay more for support than you do for our service.

You can look at the [Pricing page](https://www.algolia.com/pricing) to see what levels of support are provided by tier. You should also feel free to drop us an email at [support@algolia.com](mailto:support@algolia.com) for any issues that can’t be resolved from the documentation, or fill out the [Demo Request form](https://www.algolia.com/schedule-demo) to chat with one of our product specialists. We’re always happy to connect.

(We do offer premium support for a fee to our enterprise customers. If you would like to know more, drop us a line at [enterprise@algolia.com](mailto:enterprise@algolia.com).)
