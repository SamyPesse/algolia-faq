You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at anytime, as long as your volume of data fits in your new plan. You can do that in the [Current plan](https://www.algolia.com/users/edit#?tab=change-plan) section of the [My account](https://www.algolia.com/users/edit) tab of your Dashboard.

If you want to switch to the ENTERPRISE plan, please [contact us](mailto:enterprise@algolia.com).
