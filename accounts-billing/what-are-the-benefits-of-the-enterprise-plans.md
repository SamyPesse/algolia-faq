With our Enterprise plans, you are hosted on your own dedicated cluster:

*   You can now search on a much larger number of records (tens of millions and above).
*   Your number of indexing and search operations goes unlimited. 
*   Indexing gets faster, especially for large batches of records, thanks to a dedicated access to all the threads of the cluster.
*   You can create multiple applications on your cluster, allowing to easily manage different environments.
*   Bandwidth comes included in our Enterprise pricing so no matter your traffic, your monthly fee stays flat. 
*   We can tune the engine for your needs.
*   If you want extra peace of mind, we also offer a premium support option.
