Algolia does that out of the box. If you are using [facets](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ruby#faceting), Algolia will automatically send you the most relevant (frequent) values for each facet, depending on the current search.

If you're implementing an instant search results page, the filters will be updated at each keystroke.
