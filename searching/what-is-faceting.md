Also called filtering, faceted search is the dynamic clustering of items or search results into categories that allows users to drill into search results (or even skip searching entirely) by any value in any field.

Each facet displayed also shows the number of hits within the search that match that category. Users can then “drill down” by applying specific constraints to the search results. Faceted search is also called faceted browsing, faceted navigation, guided navigation and parametric search.You can earn more about how faceting works and how to implement it in our [documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ruby#Faceting).
