This feature is designed to help users find what they want by searching for both the singular and plural versions of the words they typed.To build it, we essentially built a dictionary of synonyms between the singular and plural versions of words in 88 different languages (main one are English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Finnish, Polish, Arabic, Turkish, Norwegian, Romanian)  
It takes into account all forms of plural:

*   Parent <-> Parents
*   Child <-> Children
*   Feet <-> Foot
*   ...

You can enable/disable this feature from your dashboard, or via the  [API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ruby#full-text-search-parameters).
