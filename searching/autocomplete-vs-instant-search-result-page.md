Algolia can be used to build a large variety of user experiences.Â The two main categories of interfaces that we see are **autocomplete menus** and **instant search results pages**:

**1/ Autocomplete menu**The autocomplete menu is an interface based on a dropdown that displays the results of the search. It can display results for one or several categories of data (one or several indices).

**2/ Instant search results page**The instant search result page is an interface where the whole page gets updated instantly as soon as the user starts typing. This is the most immersive experience.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/557c2386e4b01a224b42b2b3/images/55e016769033600a29528873/file-cIcUGfAxSe.gif)
