Elasticsearch and Solr are beautiful tools for data analysis and document search. We even use Elasticsearch to process our logs. But they were not designed to provide a great user-facing search.

In a benchmarking test, Algolia returned results up to [200x faster](http://blog.algolia.com/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/) than Elasticsearch on every query performed.Algolia provides exact prefix matching for “as you type” searching, typo-tolerance with smart result highlighting, and a ranking formula that is designed to be flexible, easy to configure and very powerful when you need to combine textual relevance and business objectives.Algolia is not only a different search algorithm, it’s a different search experience, designed to empower the users by giving them a direct and intuitive access to what they want to find.Also, Algolia provides a state of the art infrastructure, with an availability on search of 99.99%, distributed in the entire world to provide the same speed no matter where your users are.You can read more about the differences in this [Quora question](http://www.quora.com/How-does-Elastic-Search-relate-and-or-compare-to-Algolias-Search-as-a-Service) or in the [Algolia vs. Elasticsearch blog post](http://blog.algolia.com/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/).Also, we'd be happy to set up a call and answer [your questions](mailto:hey@algolia.com).
