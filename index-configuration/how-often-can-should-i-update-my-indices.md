Our API has been designed to handle dozens to thousands of indexing requests per seconds, so you can index data (by adding / update / removing records, or updating index's settings) as often as you need.

Some of our users only index new data once a day, others prefer to do it on the fly - it's really up to you based on your use case and how critical is fresh data for your business.
