Algolia limits the maximum number of search results to 1000 for a question of performance, but also to limit the access to your catalogue in case security matters to you.

If you want to retrieve more than 1000 objects, you can use our [Browse](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest#browse-all-index-content) method implemented in all our API clients. This method supports most of the search parameters, which allows you to retrieve results beyond this limit.
