It's actually pretty simple, and can be done both for the Autocomplete and the Instant Search results page.

1/ Multi-Category AutocompleteYou can follow our [multi-categories autocomplete tutorial](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tutorials/multi-auto-complete) that explains how to perform the same query on multiple indices and display results in the same auto-completion search box.2/ Multi-Category Instant Search results pageThe easiest way is to duplicate your search code: doing a search on two indices is the equivalent of doing two separate search operations.If you're not using the [Javascript helper](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-helper-js), but an API client directly, you can alsoÂ [batch your queries](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js#batch-writes).As a side note, searching on N indices will generate N search operations, which has an impact on the [pricing](https://www.algolia.com/pricing).
