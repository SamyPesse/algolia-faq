Yes.

If you have an array-based attribute, we have a couple of methods to add or remove some elements of this array (via "Add", "Remove" and "AddUnique" operations). You can find them in our [documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest#partially-update-an-object)).

They are handy when you don't want to recreate and re-update the array entirely.
